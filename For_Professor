The systems used are API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB
To test the functionality of inputting data you can access Lambda. Access the pushData fuction and edit the Test event to add the data you want.
To test the functionality of reading data you can either access the ReadData function in Lambda and press Test or through API Gateway. You can access the Testing_DB_Functionality API and use either the GET or POST resource (they currently do the same thing)
and go to the Test tab, scroll to the bottom, and click Test.
